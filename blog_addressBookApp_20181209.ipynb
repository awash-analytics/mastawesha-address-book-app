    "Mastawesha means an address book in Amharic. [Awash Analytics](http://awash-analytics.info/) recently built address book application using a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language%29) programming language. The address book project is described [here](http://awash-analytics.info/project-detail/?pdb=25), and it belongs to Martyr2 programming challenges which was posted on our website sometimes ago. In this blog post, I walk you through the source code used by the AddressBook App, and with a demo showing you how to signup as a new user of the app and then how to login to the app. In the demo, I show you how to add friends into your contacts list. Let's dive into it."
